<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second year Electrical Engineering master's student at McGill University, advised by Prof. James J. Clark. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Honors Computer Science at McGill University. 

My research interests lie in computer vision and generative modeling, with a special focus on leveraging generative models for zero-shot inference and optimization task, including image/video editing, and efficient guidance methods for visual generation, model-based optimization and combinatorial optimization. Beside of this, I am also interested in various reasoning tasks, including visual reasoning and LLMs for reasoning.
