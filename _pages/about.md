<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second year master's student in Electrical Engineering at McGill University, advised by Prof. James J. Clark. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree with honors in Computer Science at McGill University. 

My research interests primarily lie in computer vision and generative modeling, with a special focus on leveraging generative models for zero-shot inference and optimization task, including image/video editing, and efficient guidance methods for visual generation, model-based optimization and combinatorial optimization. Beside of that, I am also interested in neural symbolic reasoning, including visual reasoning and multi-model reasoning for geometric problem solving.

# Miscellaneous
Outside of research, I‚Äôm also a passionate fan of various FPS games, including Overwatch 2, Apex Legends, Valorant, Delta Force, Destiny 2, and more. I‚Äôve achieved outstanding competitive results in some of them, reaching Master rank in Overwatch 2 (Seasons 3 and 15) and Apex Legends (Seasons 17 and 21). I'm always looking for new teammates to play with, so feel free to reach out if you‚Äôd like to join!
